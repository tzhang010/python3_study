# 2. use DEFAULT PARAMETERS to show data efficiently, when you need to call the 
# function, just fill in the necessary parameters. If you don't fill the 
# parameters in order, then you need to enter the name of the parameter. 
# NOTE that we need to add " city = 'Tokyo'" in line 33.

# NOTE that the default parameters MUST be pointed to immutable objects, 
# otherwise they may be changed after call and you'll get mistakes afterwards.
