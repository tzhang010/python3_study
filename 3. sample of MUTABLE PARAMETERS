# use MUTABLE PARAMETERS when you don't know how many parameters would be 
# entered when the function is called. After using * , the parameter receives
# a tuple and use the tuple in calculation when the function is called.

# for example: calaulating a^2 + b^2 + ...
def cal_old(numbers):
	sum = 0
	for n in numbers:
		sum += n*n
	return sum
print(cal_old([1,2,3]))

	sum = 0
	for n in numbers:
		sum += n*n
	return sum
print(cal_new(1, 2, 3))		# In this situation, numbers is a tuple.

# use a list or a tuple as the mutable parameter:
list_a = (2, 3, 4)
print(cal_new(*list_a))
list_b = [2,3,4]
print(cal_new(*list_b))
